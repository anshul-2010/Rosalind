# Rosalind Problem Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various problems from [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/), a platform for learning bioinformatics through problem-solving.

## About Rosalind

[Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/) is a platform that offers a collection of bioinformatics problems for learning and practicing computational biology and bioinformatics. Each problem presents a unique challenge related to biological data analysis and requires writing code to solve it.

## Directory Structure

- **Python Village**: If you are completely new to programming, try these initial problems to learn a few basics about the Python programming language. You'll get familiar with the operations needed to start solving bioinformatics challenges in the Stronghold.
- **Bioinformatics Stronghold**: Discover the algorithms underlying a variety of bioinformatics topics: computational mass spectrometry, alignment, dynamic programming, genome assembly, genome rearrangements, phylogeny, probability, string algorithms and others.
- **Bioinformatics Armory**: Ready-to-use software tools abound for bioinformatics analysis. Whereas in the Stronghold you implement algorithms on your own, in the Armory you solve similar problems by using existing tools.
- **Bioinformatics Textbook Track**: A collection of exercises to accompany Bioinformatics Algorithms: An Active-Learning Approach by Phillip Compeau & Pavel Pevzner. A full version of this text is hosted on stepic.org
- **Algorithmic Heights**: A collection of exercises in introductory algorithms to accompany "Algorithms", the popular textbook by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, and Vazirani.

## How to Use

Each subdirectory under `/scripts` corresponds to a specific Rosalind problem. You can explore the code, understand the solutions, and run them on your own machine. Ensure you have the necessary programming language installed.

## Contributing
